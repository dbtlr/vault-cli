//! Hand-authored canned `--help` examples per command path.

//! Per the Phase 2 design spec, examples are biased toward fewer — empty is
//! the correct answer for many commands. The match below returns `vec![]`
//! for any command path with no authored examples; the renderer skips the
//! `EXAMPLES` section when the table is empty.
//!
//! Each entry is `(command_line, comment)`. Comments are ≤60 chars, lowercase
//! except for required literals, no trailing period. The command line uses
//! the literal `vault` prefix; the renderer styles tokens per palette.

Each rule produces findings with a stable code and a severity (`error`, `warning`, `info`).\n\nFindings cover three surfaces. Frontmatter findings come from schema rules — codes like `frontmatter-required-field-missing` and `frontmatter-disallowed-value`. Link findings come from graph facts — `link-unresolved` and `link-ambiguous`. Document diagnostics come from parse — malformed frontmatter, encoding issues. Validate never writes files.\n\nExit code is `1` when any finding has severity `error`, `0` otherwise. Pipelines gate on this exit code.\n\nTriage filters combine with AND across types and OR within a type. `--severity error --code frontmatter-required-field-missing` returns errors that match that code. `--code link-unresolved --code link-ambiguous` returns either. `--path 'notes/**'` scopes to a path glob; `--field`, `--rule`, `--target`, and `--reason` narrow further.",

Supported findings produce a `PlannedChange` — the path, the field, the new value, and the source document's hash recorded at plan time. Skipped findings carry a reason: `unsupported`, `ambiguous`, `missing_hash`, or `precondition_failed`.\n\nA planned change:\n\n{\n  \"path\": \"notes/welcome.md\",\n  \"field\": \"kind\",\n  \"new_value\": \"note\",\n  \"document_hash\": \"a3f2…\"\n}\n\nA skipped finding records the reason:\n\n{\n  \"path\": \"drafts/x.md\",\n  \"code\": \"link-ambiguous\",\n  \"skip_reason\": \"ambiguous\"\n}\n\nThe plan captures a vault snapshot. Each change records the document's hash at plan time; apply refuses to write if that hash has changed.
