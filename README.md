# vault-cli

Experimental Rust CLI for deterministic Markdown vault graph indexing.

The current binary name is `vault`.

## Build

Install repo tools with `mise`:

```bash
mise install
```

```bash
cargo build -p vault-cli
```

The debug binary is written to:

```bash
target/debug/vault
```

To install it onto your Cargo bin path:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/vault-cli
```

With `just` installed, common commands are available as:

```bash
just build
just test
just verify
just run -C fixtures/basic docs list --format jsonl
```

## v0 Scope

```bash
vault docs list --format jsonl
vault docs list --filter status:draft --format jsonl
vault docs list --path "Workspaces/**/tasks/*.md" --has workspace --format jsonl
vault docs summary --count-by status --format json
vault cache build --cache .vault/cache --format json
vault links list --format jsonl
vault files --format jsonl
vault links unresolved --format jsonl
vault links backlinks <path-or-stem-or-file> --format jsonl
vault docs inspect <path-or-stem> --format json
vault validate --format jsonl
vault validate --summary --format json
vault -C <path> validate --summary --format json
```

Commands run against the current directory by default. Use global `-C, --cwd
<dir>` to run against another vault directory. When `--config` is omitted,
`vault` discovers `<cwd>/.vault/config.yaml` if it exists; missing discovered
config is fine and uses defaults. Explicit relative `--config` paths and
relative `--cache` paths resolve against the effective cwd.

All commands accept global `--config <path>` for explicit YAML configuration.
The current config shape is:

```yaml
files:
  ignore:
    - "**/__pycache__/**"
    - "**/*.pyc"
validate:
  ignore:
    - "Archive/**"
    - "System/Templates/**"
  required_frontmatter:
    - title
  rules:
    - name: workspace-notes
      match:
        path: "Workspaces/**/notes/*.md"
      required_frontmatter:
        - type
        - kind
        - workspace
    - name: typed-note
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: note
      required_frontmatter:
        - kind
      field_types:
        created: datetime
        modified: datetime
        aliases: list_of_strings
        workspace: wikilink
    - name: task-status
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: task
      required_frontmatter:
        - status
      allowed_values:
        status:
          - backlog
          - in_progress
          - completed
          - wont_do
      allowed_paths:
        - "Workspaces/**/tasks/*.md"
    - name: agent-artifact
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: agent-artifact
      forbidden_frontmatter:
        - kind
      allowed_paths:
        - "Workspaces/**/agent-artifacts/*.md"
```

For the conceptual model of validate rules, see [docs/rule-shape.md](docs/rule-shape.md).

Configured ignores are applied before file inventory and document parsing. With no config, the graph remains a raw filesystem view except for hidden files/directories.

Ignored targets remain outside the graph. If an indexed Markdown document links to an ignored file, that link is reported as unresolved rather than hidden.

The first pass is stateless and read-only. It walks Markdown files, parses generic frontmatter, extracts headings, extracts Markdown links and wikilinks, and resolves links against vault-relative paths or unique note stems. Exact path lookup is case-sensitive; stem lookup is case-insensitive.

The raw graph aims to follow Obsidian-style internal link behavior before applying any future standards-pack semantics. It includes body wikilinks, embeds, frontmatter/property wikilinks, URL-decoded Markdown internal links, extensionless Markdown note links, same-note heading/block references, Markdown image links to local files, and existing non-Markdown attachment targets.

Frontmatter link extraction is intentionally shallow in v0.x: it scans top-level scalar string properties and top-level lists of strings. Nested YAML object/list leaves are not graph links until the schema layer or a real vault need makes that boundary worth expanding.

Use `source_context.area` and `source_context.property` to distinguish body links from frontmatter/property links. Frontmatter links now include `source_span` for the shallow extraction cases. `vault files` emits the file inventory, and `vault links backlinks <exact-file-path>` can query incoming links to non-Markdown attachment targets.

`vault validate` is read-only. It reports unresolved links, ambiguous links,
document diagnostics, configured missing frontmatter fields, invalid
frontmatter field types, forbidden frontmatter fields, path-location
violations, and configured disallowed frontmatter values without mutating
files. Global `validate.required_frontmatter` applies to every document that is
not skipped by `validate.ignore`. Scoped `validate.rules` apply additional
requirements only to documents matched by `match.path`, `match.path_not`, and
`match.frontmatter`; findings include `rule` when a scoped rule produced them.
Rule-level `exclude.path` can remove a path subset from a specific rule without
removing those files from the graph.

Use `vault validate --summary` to emit grouped finding counts instead of raw
findings. Summary output includes total findings plus counts by `code`,
`severity`, `rule`, frontmatter `field`, disallowed field value, and top-level
path prefix.

`vault docs list` supports small inventory filters: `--path <glob>` for
vault-relative paths, repeatable `--filter field:value` for frontmatter scalar
or list values, comma-separated value sets such as `status:backlog,completed`,
and `--has <field>` / `--missing <field>` for field presence. Repeated filters
are ANDed; comma-separated values within one `--filter` are ORed. `vault docs
summary --count-by <field>` emits grouped document counts for one frontmatter
field.

## Glob Matching

Config path patterns and `docs list --path` patterns are matched against
vault-relative paths using path-segment semantics:

- `*` matches within one path segment only.
- `**` matches zero or more complete path segments.
- `Workspaces/*/*.md` matches `Workspaces/app/root.md`, but not
  `Workspaces/app/notes/note.md`.
- `Workspaces/**/*.md` matches markdown files at any depth under `Workspaces`.
- `Workspaces/**/notes/*.md` matches files directly inside a `notes` directory,
  including nested workspace paths, but not files in subdirectories below
  `notes`.

## Validate Rule Matching

Scoped validate rules support path and frontmatter predicates. All predicates are
ANDed. `match.path_not` excludes matching paths from a rule. Missing frontmatter
fields do not match. Frontmatter predicates use exact, type-sensitive equality
for strings, booleans, and numbers.
Rules can also constrain allowed scalar field values with `allowed_values`.
Allowed-value checks are exact and type-sensitive.
Rules can validate present field shapes with `field_types`, forbid fields with
`forbidden_frontmatter`, and report folder-routing violations with
`allowed_paths`.

```yaml
validate:
  rules:
    - name: note-kind
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: note
      required_frontmatter:
        - kind

    - name: task-status
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: task
      required_frontmatter:
        - status
      allowed_values:
        status:
          - backlog
          - in_progress
          - completed
          - wont_do
      allowed_paths:
        - "Workspaces/**/tasks/*.md"

    - name: agent-artifact
      match:
        path: "**/*.md"
        frontmatter:
          type: agent-artifact
      forbidden_frontmatter:
        - kind
      allowed_paths:
        - "Workspaces/**/agent-artifacts/*.md"
```

Supported `field_types` are `datetime`, `date`, `list_of_strings`, `wikilink`,
and `wikilink_or_list`. Field type checks only run when the field is present;
use `required_frontmatter` when presence is also required.
