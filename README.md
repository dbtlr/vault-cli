# vault

Deterministic Markdown vault graph, link, and validation tooling.

> `vault` gives humans and agents the same deterministic view of a Markdown vault: documents, links, frontmatter, validation findings, and machine-readable drift reports.

The current binary name is `vault`. The crate is `vault-cli`.

## Why vault?

`vault` is a CLI for inspecting and healing drift in a Markdown vault you own. It walks your files, builds a graph (documents, headings, links, attachments), and lets you assert standards against it with a `validate -> plan -> apply -> verify` loop. The graph and validation passes are read-only; repair is explicit and produces inspectable JSON artifacts that you (or an agent) review before applying.

What it is:

- A deterministic graph of your vault's documents, links, and frontmatter.
- A configurable validation layer (`validate.rules` in `.vault/config.yaml`).
- A planned, applyable repair layer with schema-versioned JSON plans.
- Stable JSON and JSONL contracts so the same output drives humans, scripts, and agents.

What it isn't:

- A LLM-backed rewriter. Repairs are deterministic transformations declared in config.
- A semantic search engine. Search is literal substring + frontmatter + path glob.
- A daemon, server, or sync tool. It runs once per invocation against a vault on disk.

## Install

The fastest path is the hosted shell installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/dbtlr/vault-cli/releases/latest/download/vault-cli-installer.sh \
  | sh
```

Build from source with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dbtlr/vault-cli vault-cli
```

For manual binary downloads, the safer download-then-run installer form, and verification steps, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Quick start

Clone the repo, then run three commands against the bundled fixture vault:

```bash
vault -C fixtures/basic find --all --format records
vault -C fixtures/basic validate --summary
vault -C fixtures/basic validate --code 'link-*' --format jsonl | head
```

You should see a small inventory of Markdown documents, a finding summary that includes a handful of intentional drift cases, and a JSONL stream of unresolved links from the fixture.

Run the same shape against your own vault:

```bash
vault -C /path/to/vault validate --summary
vault -C /path/to/vault find --all --format paths | head
```

For a deeper walkthrough including scoped rules and a first repair plan, see [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Core workflows

| Workflow | Command shape | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Inventory documents | `vault find --all --format records` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| Inspect one document | `vault get <path-or-stem>` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| Walk unresolved links | `vault validate --code 'link-*'` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| Validate against rules | `vault validate --summary` | [validation.md](docs/validation.md) |
| Plan a repair | `vault repair plan --out repair.json` | [validation.md](docs/validation.md) |
| Apply a repair | `vault repair apply repair.json --verify` | [validation.md](docs/validation.md) |
| Move a document | `vault move <src> <dst>` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| Delete a document | `vault delete <doc>` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| Find | `vault find --text "..." --eq k:v` | [commands.md](docs/commands.md) |

Commands accept `--format json|jsonl` (stable contracts) plus format-specific human-readable options (`records`, `text`, `paths`). JSON and JSONL contracts are stable across point releases; human-readable formats may evolve.

## For agents and automation

`vault` is designed to be a first-class tool for coding agents:

- **Stable contracts.** JSON for one-shot dispatch, JSONL for streaming queues, and a schema-versioned repair plan (`schema_version: 9`).
- **Plan/apply boundary.** Mutation is always two steps: produce a plan artifact, then apply it. Apply rejects mismatched vault roots, stale document hashes, and unsupported schema versions.
- **Filterable triage.** `--code`, `--severity`, `--field`, `--rule`, `--path`, `--target`, `--reason` apply to both raw output and `--summary`, so an agent can size a queue before reading it.
- **Vault targeting.** Use `-C <path>` (or `--cwd <path>`) to point `vault` at a specific vault root, or omit it to run against the current directory.

For the agent-facing contract, start at [docs/agent-workflows.md](docs/agent-workflows.md). To install the agent skill into your coding agent of choice, see [integrations/agent-skill/README.md](integrations/agent-skill/README.md).

## Project status

`vault` is pre-1.0. Minor releases may include breaking changes to CLI flags, config keys, and JSON contracts. Breaking changes are called out in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with migration notes.

The current focus is the deterministic drift-healing loop (validate -> plan -> apply -> verify). Severity escalation, output schema versioning envelopes, and link/path apply are tracked for v0.27 and beyond.

## Development

Set up the toolchain with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for common recipes:

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- just build
mise exec -- just test
mise exec -- just verify
```
