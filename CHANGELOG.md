# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once it ships v1.0. Pre-1.0 versions may include breaking changes in minor releases.

## [Unreleased]

Entries here have landed on `main` but have not yet been cut into a tagged release. When a release is cut, this section is promoted to `## v0.X.0 - YYYY-MM-DD` and a fresh `## [Unreleased]` header is added above it.

### Added

- **SQLite cache as the read path for query commands** (v1). Reintroduces a cache surface that was removed in v0.26.0 — this time, query commands actually consume it. Closes the "every command does a full filesystem rescan" performance gap.
  - Cache lives at `~/.cache/vault/<sha256(canonical-vault-root)>/cache.db` (honors `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`). Directory is `0700`, database file is `0600`. Identity hash uses the canonical vault-root path so symlinked roots, `--vault registry-name`, and direct cwd-discovery all resolve to the same cache.
  - New `vault cache` subcommand: `index` (incremental, default), `rebuild` (full from scratch), `clear` (delete the cache file), `status` (path, size, doc/file/link counts, schema version, last full rebuild). `index --rebuild` and `index --force-hash` flags; `status --format json|text`. New global flag `--no-cache-refresh` skips the implicit refresh before query commands.
  - Query commands (`validate`, `docs`, `files`, `links`, `repair plan/apply`, `search`) now load from the cache via a shared helper. The cache is refreshed transparently before each command unless `--no-cache-refresh` is set. Lock contention during refresh downgrades to a stderr notice and reads stale; never errors.
  - Cache schema starts at `v2` (bumped during implementation to persist `Link.unresolved_reason`, `Link.candidates`, and a new `diagnostics` table; the v1 → v2 jump was internal and never released).
  - Self-heal triggers on `Cache::open`: missing file, schema older than the binary, identity drift (vault root path changed), and SQLite corruption (failed `PRAGMA integrity_check`) all auto-rebuild silently with a one-line stderr message. Only a *newer*-than-known schema hard-errors (interpreting unknown future fields is the destructive risk).
  - Incremental updates use a `(mtime, size)` cheap-check then blake3 hash-verify on mismatch. `--force-hash` skips the cheap-check for filesystems where mtime is unreliable (NFS, Docker bind-mounts on macOS, rsync-restored vaults, post-`git-restore-mtime` workflows).
  - Aggressive invalidation: any change to a file drops that doc's rows + every incoming link targeting it; added files re-resolve every link whose target could now match.
  - Concurrency: SQLite WAL mode for parallel reads; advisory `flock(2)` write lock at `<cache_dir>/.lock` with a 5-second timeout for `cache index|rebuild|clear`. Read commands never block.
  - Performance: cold rebuild on a 1k-doc fixture clocks under 200 ms in our perf regression test (target was < 2s); warm reads on an unchanged vault stay near steady-state. The `vault-cache` crate ships its own property test (`incremental == from-scratch` for random op sequences) and a `#[ignore]`-gated perf gate.
  - New `vault-cache` workspace crate. SQL-direct queries and FTS5 are designed-for but not implemented; tracked separately as v3 (command migrations) and v4 (FTS5) in the atlas vault.
  - `body_text` field added to `vault_core::Document`, populated during parse. Pre-positions FTS5 to land later without a full vault re-scan.
- New `--no-cache-refresh` global flag.
- **Cache query API foundations** (v2 — internal plumbing for the upcoming v3 command migrations). New typed methods on `vault_cache::Cache` that query the persisted schema directly instead of reconstructing a full `GraphIndex`:
  - `documents_matching(&DocumentQuery) -> Vec<DocumentSummary>` — SQL-narrowed scan. Frontmatter predicates push into SQL via `json_extract` with the JSON path bound as a parameter (closes the SQL-injection vector and supports any character in frontmatter keys, including hyphens and dots). Path globs apply via a Rust post-pass using the same `vault_graph::pattern_matches_path` matcher v1's `filter_documents` uses.
  - `document_by_path(&Utf8Path) -> Option<Document>` — single-doc fetch with full joined data (headings, block_ids, links, diagnostics). For `docs inspect`-style use.
  - `files() -> Vec<VaultFile>` — non-markdown inventory.
  - `links() / links_unresolved() / backlinks_to(&Utf8Path) -> Vec<Link>` — link queries; all share a private row-decoder.
  - `diagnostics() -> Vec<(Utf8PathBuf, Diagnostic)>` — per-doc diagnostic rows.
  - `has_diagnostic_errors() -> bool` — single `SELECT EXISTS` primitive for exit-code derivation on cache-direct command paths.
- `vault_core::DocumentSummary` — lean projection type (`path`, `stem`, `hash`, `frontmatter`, `body_text`) returned by `documents_matching`. `Document` minus the joined tables. Implements `From<Document>` and `From<&Document>` for use by helpers that don't need the joined data.
- `vault_standards::validate_rule(&ValidateRule, &[DocumentSummary]) -> Vec<Finding>` — per-rule validate entrypoint that accepts a pre-narrowed scope. The existing `validate(&GraphIndex, &ValidateConfig)` keeps working unchanged.

### Changed

- Query commands no longer rebuild the in-memory `GraphIndex` from a full filesystem scan on every invocation. They open the cache, optionally refresh it, and reconstruct `GraphIndex` from rows. Existing query logic is unchanged — only the source of the index moved from "filesystem walk" to "cache read".
- Content hashing in the cache uses blake3 throughout (matches `vault_graph`'s existing hash; the implementation plan's SHA-256 specification was corrected to blake3 during execution to avoid mismatches with parser-emitted hashes).
- `vault_cli::filter::DocumentSummary` renamed to `DocsSummaryReport`. The renamed struct is the aggregation report from `summarize_documents` — the new name reflects what it actually is, and frees the `DocumentSummary` name for the new `vault_core` projection. Internal rename; no command behavior change.

### Notes

- No version bump for this work. The cache is at v1 + v2 (foundations); we'll dogfood on `main` and bundle the version bump with v3 (query command migrations) and v4 (FTS5 native search) once that work lands.
- v2's planned command migrations (`docs query`, `docs summary`, `links list`, `search`, `validate`, `repair plan`) are **deferred to v3** pending a command-by-command user-story re-evaluation. Some commands may be redesigned, consolidated, or removed rather than directly migrated. The cache query API above is the foundation v3 will build on.
- Operator documentation: `docs/cache.md`.
- Follow-ups already tracked in the atlas vault: `cache-telemetry-and-doctor` (observability for slow-query debugging), `repair-plan-schema-self-heal` (apply the same self-heal posture to repair-plan v3→v4), `self-heal-audit` (broader CLI surface review).

## v0.28.0 - 2026-05-18

Closes the validate → plan → apply → verify loop for `frontmatter-required-field-missing` and `document-misrouted` findings by adding two new repair actions. Bumps the repair plan JSON schema to v4.

### Breaking changes

- **Repair plan JSON schema bumps from v3 to v4.** `vault repair apply` rejects v3 plans with `unsupported repair plan schema version: expected 4, got 3`. No migration shim. Regenerate any persisted plans with `vault repair plan` against v0.28.0+.
- **`PlannedChange` adds new top-level fields** (`destination`, `link_risk`, `warnings`). The `field` field changes from `String` to `Option<String>` (`None` for `move_document` changes). Any tooling consuming the plan JSON must handle the new fields (or ignore them) and the optional field shape; strict-schema consumers will need updates.
- **`vault repair apply`'s default blast radius is wider when a plan contains `move_document` actions.** Apply now writes to every file containing a classifiable backlink to a moved file, not just the moved file itself. Agents and scripts that assumed `repair apply` only touches files named in `changes[].path` should now also expect writes to the files named in each move change's `link_risk.*.source_path` entries. The apply output's `moved_files` and `rewritten_links` reflect all written paths.

### Added

- `add_frontmatter` repair action — inserts a missing frontmatter field with a literal value. Refuses if the field already exists (use `set_frontmatter` for replacement). Same minimal-edit YAML preservation as set/remove.
- `move_document` repair action — moves or renames a file. Accepts `to_directory` (sugar: file moves into the directory, filename preserved) or `to_path` (full destination including filename for rename or move+rename). Both support `{stem}`, `{filename}`, `{frontmatter.<field>}` placeholder substitution.
- Automatic backlink rewriting on move. `vault repair apply` rewrites all classifiable backlinks (path-qualified wikilinks, Markdown links, and stem-only wikilinks when the stem changes) alongside the move. No flag required.
- `PlanWarning::StemCollisionAfterMove` — informational warning attached to a planned move when the new stem already exists elsewhere in the vault. Non-blocking; reported in both plan and apply output.
- `vault repair links --move-to <path>` — read-only analysis showing the link risk and warnings a proposed move would produce, without authoring a repair rule.
- New `ApplyError` variants: `FieldAlreadyPresent`, `MoveDestinationExists`, `MoveSourceMissing`, `MoveSourceIsSymlink`.

### Changed

- The validate → plan → apply → verify loop now closes for `frontmatter-required-field-missing` and `document-misrouted` findings when a matching repair rule supplies the deterministic detail.
- Substitution failures (missing frontmatter field, non-scalar value) skip the finding with `skip_reason: precondition_failed` and a specific reason string surfaced in the plan's `skipped_findings`.

### Known limitations

- When a backlinking file contains multiple identical link occurrences pointing at a moved file, `repair apply` rewrites only the first occurrence. Subsequent occurrences will flag as unresolved on the next `vault validate`. To be addressed in a follow-up by adopting byte-span-precise edits.

## v0.27.0 - 2026-05-18

Shell completion install UX.

### Added

- `vault completions install [shell]` writes the right shell-integration line (or script file, for fish and nushell) to the user's shell config. Auto-detects from `$SHELL` if no shell argument given. Idempotent via a marker comment block; `--force` replaces an existing install; `--print` previews without writing. Supported shells: bash, zsh, fish, powershell, elvish, nushell.
- `vault completions init <shell>` emits the completion script to stdout (was `vault completions <shell>`).
- `clap_complete_nushell` dependency for nushell completion script generation. `build.rs` now also emits `target/completions/vault.nu` alongside the bash/zsh/fish scripts.

### Changed

- The hidden `vault completions <shell>` subcommand has been replaced by the visible `vault completions init <shell>` subcommand. Scripts or agent skills that invoked the old form must update.
- The `completions` command group is now visible in `vault --help` (was hidden in v0.26.x).
- `manpage` remains hidden in `vault --help`. (A future `vault manpage install` task is tracked separately.)

### Removed

- The hidden `vault completions <SHELL>` subcommand syntax (use `vault completions init <SHELL>`).

## v0.26.2 - 2026-05-18

Release-pipeline patch on top of v0.26.1. The v0.26.1 tag was pushed but the release workflow failed before publishing artifacts; this version supersedes it. No user-facing CLI behavior changes.

### Fixed

- `build.rs` now generates `target/completions/{vault.bash,_vault,vault.fish}` and `target/man/vault.1` as a side effect of every `cargo build`. Previously the cargo-dist release workflow listed those paths in `dist-workspace.toml`'s `include` directive but never invoked the `just completions` / `just manpage` recipes that produced them, so packaging failed. The hidden `vault completions <shell>` and `vault manpage` subcommands are unchanged; the Justfile recipes remain as convenience wrappers.
- Dropped `rust-version = "1.95"` from `crates/vault-cli/Cargo.toml`. Cargo-dist's `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` builder ships rustc 1.93.1 and rejected the build with "rustc 1.93.1 is not supported". vault-cli does not yet publish to crates.io, so the field was informational only. CI continues to track latest stable via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` and `mise.toml`. The MSRV policy in `docs/development.md` is updated to explain the omission.

### Changed

- `InspectOutput` moved from `crates/vault-cli/src/cli.rs` to `crates/vault-cli/src/target.rs`. This keeps `cli.rs` free of intra-crate dependencies so `build.rs` can include it via `#[path = "src/cli.rs"]` without pulling in the full graph crates as build-dependencies. Internal refactor only; no public surface change.

## v0.26.1 - 2026-05-18

First installer-backed release. GitHub-readiness work: standard repo files, public Cargo metadata, README/docs reorganization, generic agent skill template, CI workflow with quality gates, shell completions / man page, and hosted shell installer via cargo-dist. No code behavior changes beyond the new hidden `completions` and `manpage` subcommands.

### Added

- `LICENSE` (MIT, 2026 Drew Butler).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` (security reports to `hi@dbtlr.com`).
- `.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly Cargo + GitHub Actions updates), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md` and `feature.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- Public package metadata on `crates/vault-cli/Cargo.toml`: `authors`, `description`, `repository`, `homepage`, `readme`, `categories`, `keywords`, `rust-version = "1.95"` (latest stable policy).
- Concise `README.md` landing page; dense reference material moved into focused `docs/` pages (`installation.md`, `quickstart.md`, `concepts.md`, `commands.md`, `configuration.md`, `validation.md`, `agent-workflows.md`, `development.md`, `releases.md`). `AGENTS.md` slimmed to a ~30-line agent contract pointing at `docs/agent-workflows.md`.
- `integrations/agent-skill/SKILL.md` — single harness-independent agent skill. `integrations/agent-skill/README.md` documents the two install paths: `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, `.agents/skills/` for every other coding agent (Codex, Open Code, OpenClaw, Hermes, PI).
- `examples/config-minimal.yaml`, `examples/config-typed-notes.yaml`, `examples/repair-recipe.sh` (executable), `examples/README.md` — generic Markdown vault content.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix CI on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest. Runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --workspace --locked`, `cargo build -p vault-cli --release --locked`, `cargo install --path crates/vault-cli --locked`, `vault --help`, fixture validation, repo self-validation, `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`, and `shellcheck examples/repair-recipe.sh`. Triggers: push to main, pull_request, weekly cron.
- `deny.toml` — conservative supply-chain policy. Permissive license allow list (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3-Clause, ISC, Unicode-DFS-2016, Unicode-3.0, Zlib); denies yanked advisories, unknown registries, unknown git sources; warns on wildcards and unmaintained crates.
- `.vault/config.yaml` — repo-root dogfood config requiring `title` + `description` frontmatter on `docs/**/*.md`. CI asserts zero findings.
- Hidden `vault completions <shell>` and `vault manpage` subcommands that emit shell completions (bash, zsh, fish) and a roff-formatted man page to stdout. Wired into `Justfile` (`just completions`, `just manpage`) and smoke-tested in CI.
- `dist-workspace.toml` configures cargo-dist 0.30.2 to ship `vault` binaries for `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`. The hosted shell installer at `https://github.com/dbtlr/vault-cli/releases/latest/download/vault-cli-installer.sh` is the recommended install path.
- Shell completions for bash, zsh, and fish, plus a man page, ship alongside the binary in every release archive (`vault-cli-<target>.tar.xz`).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (generated by `cargo dist init`) runs the release pipeline on tag push (`v*.*.*`). Pull requests trigger a dry-run plan that asserts the configuration without uploading artifacts.
- `docs/installation.md` documents both pipe-to-sh and download-then-run install forms plus a verification recipe.
- `Justfile` recipes: `dist-plan`, `dist-build-local`, `release version` (existing `release` recipe renamed to `build-release`).
- Keep a Changelog format header at the top of this file.

### Changed

- `Justfile` — removed the stale `fixture-build-cache` recipe (the `vault cache build` command was removed in v0.26.0).
- `docs/rule-shape.md` — added `title` and `description` frontmatter so the repo self-validation passes against the pre-existing page.
- Root `Cargo.toml` — added `[profile.dist]` (inherits release, `lto = "thin"`) used by cargo-dist's release builds.

## v0.26.0 - 2026-05-18

Structural cleanup release: apply migration to vault-standards, minimal-edit YAML preservation, repair plan schema v3 with SkipReason taxonomy, config schema serde rewrite, SQLite cache deletion, foundation tests across pure-parsing crates, and bundled CLI polish. Four-slice cleanup, four merged branches, 193 tests passing.

### Breaking changes

- **Repair plan JSON schema bumps from v2 to v3.**
  - `RepairPlan` drops the separate `unsupported_findings` and `ambiguous_findings` top-level arrays. Use `skipped_findings` (single canonical list) and filter by `skip_reason` (`unsupported` | `ambiguous` | `missing_hash` | `precondition_failed`).
  - `RepairPlanSummary` drops flat `skipped_findings` / `unsupported_findings` / `ambiguous_findings` count fields. Use `summary.skipped.{unsupported,ambiguous,missing_hash,precondition_failed,total}`.
  - `RepairApplyReport.plan_context` restructures from three flat counts to nest a `skipped` object matching the plan's summary shape.
  - `vault repair apply` rejects v2 plans with `unsupported repair plan schema version: expected 3, got 2`.
  - Migration:
    ```text
    old: plan.unsupported_findings.length
    new: plan.skipped_findings.filter(f => f.skip_reason === "unsupported").length

    old: plan.summary.unsupported_findings
    new: plan.summary.skipped.unsupported

    old: apply.plan_context.unsupported_findings
    new: apply.plan_context.skipped.unsupported
    ```
- **`vault cache build` command removed.** The SQLite cache was write-only with no consumer; future warm-state needs (LSP/MCP/daemon) will be designed against memory-resident indexes instead.
- **`VaultFile.hash` is now `Option<String>`.** Non-Markdown attachment files no longer carry BLAKE3 hashes — only Markdown documents (which need them for repair preconditions). Path identity remains stable; backlink queries by exact attachment path are unaffected.

### Added

- **Apply migration to `vault-standards`.** New `vault-standards::apply` module with `ApplyError`, `RepairApplyReport`, `validate_plan_for_apply`, `changes_by_path`, `apply_file_changes`. Apply contract logic now lives in the engine crate, not the binary crate. CLI `repair_apply.rs` shrinks from ~230 lines to ~75 of orchestration.
- **Minimal-edit YAML preservation.** `vault repair apply` no longer rewrites the entire frontmatter mapping through `serde_yaml::to_string`. YAML lines untouched by a repair are preserved byte-for-byte (comments, quote style, key ordering). Touched values preserve the original quote style when the new value can be expressed in it; double-quoted stays double-quoted, single-quoted stays single-quoted. Closes the v0.24 Atlas quote-churn issue.
- **`vault-frontmatter::top_level_property_spans`** returning `PropertySpan { name, line_range, value_range, style }` for byte-range YAML editing.
- **`vault-frontmatter::serialize_value_preserving_style`** with upgrade-only quote-style rules.
- **`SkipReason` taxonomy.** Each `SkippedFinding` carries a tagged `skip_reason` (`unsupported` | `ambiguous` | `missing_hash` | `precondition_failed`) — replaces the prior string-heuristic `is_ambiguous_skipped` and the three overlapping result vectors. `MissingHash` produces a clearer message ("document hash not present in index — file may have been removed or renamed") instead of the previous misleading "inspect the repair rule".
- **`vault-standards::config::parse_config`** as the single config entry point. Replaces the prior split between `serde_yaml::from_str` (CLI) and `validate_config_yaml` (engine).
- **`vault_core::display`** module exposing `link_kind_str`, `link_status_str`, `severity_str`, `unresolved_reason_str` — one source of truth for enum-to-string mappings previously duplicated across three CLI files.
- **Foundation tests** in `vault-core`, `vault-frontmatter`, `vault-links`, and `vault-standards` covering parsing rules, link resolution, frontmatter offsets, repair classification, and validate engine smoke paths. Slice 1 added ~53 tests; Slices 2 and 4 stack ~33 more. Total ~193 tests passing across the workspace.
- **`--format paths` dedupe** for `vault links list`, `links unresolved`, `links backlinks`. Multiple links from the same source path now contribute one path-list row, matching `vault validate --format paths` behavior.

### Changed

- **Config schema rewritten with serde.** `crates/vault-standards/src/config.rs` uses `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` typed structs plus a focused ~80-line `post_validate` for what serde can't express (field type whitelist, allowed_values scalar-only, repair rule action exclusivity, deprecated `graph.ignore` rename). The 519-line hand-rolled `config_schema.rs` is deleted.
- **`RepairRule.action()` method** replaces the field-flattened `RepairAction` on the struct, computed from the present-exactly-one of `set_frontmatter` / `remove_frontmatter` enforced by `post_validate`.
- **`cli.rs` argument-struct duplication removed** via `#[command(flatten)]`. `FrontmatterFilterArgs` is shared by `docs list`, `docs summary`, and `search`. `ValidateTriageArgs` is shared by `validate` and `repair plan`.
- **Subcommand `--help` groups options** under "Global options", "Filter options", and "Triage filters" via clap `help_heading`. Positional arguments on `repair apply`, `registry add`, and `registry remove` now have descriptions.
- **Wikilink and block-id regexes** now compile once per process via `std::sync::LazyLock` instead of once per call.

### Removed

- `crates/vault-graph/src/cache.rs` (283 lines).
- `crates/vault-standards/src/config_schema.rs` (519 lines).
- `rusqlite` dependency from `vault-graph` and `vault-cli` dev-deps.
- BLAKE3 hashing of non-Markdown files — `(stat::size, stat::mtime)` identity is sufficient for path-based backlink queries against attachments.
- `is_ambiguous_skipped` string heuristic.
- `RepairPlanFinding` struct (replaced by `SkippedFinding`).

### Internal

- `planned_change` returns `Result<PlannedChange, SkipReason>` instead of `Option<PlannedChange>`.
- `REPAIR_PLAN_SCHEMA_VERSION` is now a single `pub const` in `vault-standards::repair`; `vault-standards::apply::validate_plan_for_apply` references it.
- `crates/vault-cli/src/repair_apply.rs` reduced from ~230 lines to ~75 lines of orchestration. All apply contract checks moved to `vault-standards::apply`.

- Added `vault docs summary --count-by <field>` for grouped document inventory counts.
- Added warnings for unknown `--has`, `--missing`, and `--count-by` fields.

### Changed

- `vault docs inspect` now defaults to `--format json` because it emits one logical object.

## v0.16.0 - 2026-05-17

- Removed `vault graph diagnostics`; use `vault validate --format jsonl` to surface graph diagnostics as validation findings.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-05-17

Internal restructure release. **Breaking JSONL output schema for validate findings.**

### Added

- `vault-frontmatter` crate: YAML extraction and shallow property/offset utilities.
- `vault-links` crate: CommonMark link parsing, wikilink parsing, block IDs, anchor helpers, and link resolution.
- `vault-standards` crate: validate engine, `Finding` / `FindingBody` types, summary, predicates, YAML config-schema validator.
- `Finding` sum type replacing the 12-field `ValidateFinding` god-struct. Variant-specific fields only appear on findings that carry them; no more `null` defaults.
- `docs/rule-shape.md`: canonical conceptual model for validate rules (selectors + constraints).
- `Summary.invalid_types` grouping for `frontmatter-invalid-type` findings by field and expected type.

### Changed

- Renamed `vault-index` crate to `vault-graph` (matches the original modular-architecture spec and the command surface name).
- `vault-cli/src/main.rs` reduced from ~1376 lines to ~150 lines of dispatch; per-concern modules (`cli`, `config`, `output`, `filter`, `target`) carry the rest.
- `validate` (formerly `validate_findings`) is now a ~55-line orchestrator in `vault-standards::engine` dispatching to seven per-check functions, each under 40 lines.

### Renamed finding codes (breaking)

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `path-not-allowed` | `document-misrouted` |
| `frontmatter-field-value-not-allowed` | `frontmatter-disallowed-value` |
| `frontmatter-field-type-invalid` | `frontmatter-invalid-type` |
| `frontmatter-field-forbidden` | `frontmatter-forbidden-field` |

Any scripts or agent skills filtering on these codes need to update.

### Output schema (breaking)

`vault validate --format jsonl` rows are still flat JSON objects keyed by `code`, but variant-specific fields (`field`, `actual_value`, `allowed_values`, `expected_type`, `allowed_paths`, `link`, `diagnostic`) only appear on findings that carry them, rather than being emitted as `null` everywhere.

### Unchanged

- CLI command paths (`vault graph documents`, `vault graph backlinks`, `vault validate`, etc.) are identical to v0.14. The CLI surface regroup ships in v0.16.
- Config YAML keys (`graph.ignore`, `validate.required_frontmatter`, etc.) are unchanged. The `graph.ignore` rename ships in v0.16.

## v0.14.0 - 2026-05-17
