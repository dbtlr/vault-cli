# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## Unreleased (v0.26 Slice 1)

Foundation tests and quick wins toward the v0.26 cleanup. No public API or output schema changes.

### Added

- Unit tests in `vault-core`, `vault-frontmatter`, `vault-links`, and `vault-standards` covering parsing rules, link resolution, frontmatter offsets, repair classification, and validate engine smoke paths.
- `vault_core::display` module exposing `link_kind_str`, `link_status_str`, `severity_str`, `unresolved_reason_str` — one source of truth for enum-to-string mappings used by CLI output.
- `--format paths` integration test pinning the unique-source-path contract for `vault links list`.

### Changed

- Wikilink and block-id regexes now compile once per process via `std::sync::LazyLock` instead of once per call.
- `vault links list --format paths` (and `links unresolved` / `links backlinks`) now emit unique source paths — previously a document with N links contributed N rows.
- Subcommand `--help` groups global flags under "Global options" via clap `help_heading`.
- `repair apply <PLAN>`, `registry add <NAME> <PATH>`, and `registry remove <NAME>` positional arguments now have help text.

## Unreleased (v0.26 Slice 4)

Config schema rewrite, cache deletion, and CLI argument flatten.

### Breaking changes

- `vault cache build` command removed. The SQLite cache was write-only with no consumer; future warm-state needs (LSP/MCP/daemon) will be designed against memory-resident indexes instead.
- `VaultFile.hash` is now `Option<String>`. Non-Markdown attachment files no longer carry BLAKE3 hashes — only Markdown documents (which need them for repair preconditions). Path identity remains stable; backlink queries by exact attachment path are unaffected.

### Changed

- `crates/vault-standards/src/config.rs` rewritten with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` typed structs plus a focused ~80-line `post_validate`. The 519-line hand-rolled `config_schema.rs` is deleted. Behavior preserved: every previously-rejected malformed config is still rejected; error messages should be at least as informative.
- `parse_config(yaml, source_path) -> Result<VaultConfig, ConfigError>` is now the single entry point. The CLI's `load_config` delegates to it; the previous split between `serde_yaml::from_str` (CLI) and `validate_config_yaml` (engine) is gone.
- `RepairRule.action()` method replaces the field-flattened `RepairAction` on the struct, computed from the present-exactly-one of `set_frontmatter` / `remove_frontmatter` enforced by `post_validate`.
- `cli.rs` argument-struct duplication removed via `#[command(flatten)]`. `FrontmatterFilterArgs` is shared by `docs list`, `docs summary`, and `search`. `ValidateTriageArgs` is shared by `validate` and `repair plan`.
- Help text now groups filter options under "Filter options" and "Triage filters" via clap's `help_heading`.

### Removed

- `crates/vault-graph/src/cache.rs` (283 lines).
- `crates/vault-standards/src/config_schema.rs` (519 lines).
- `rusqlite` dependency from `vault-graph` and `vault-cli` dev-deps.
- BLAKE3 hashing of non-Markdown files — `(stat::size, stat::mtime)` identity is sufficient for path-based backlink queries against attachments.

## Unreleased (v0.26 Slice 2)

Apply migration and minimal-edit YAML preservation. Breaking change in `vault-standards` public surface; no JSON output schema break in Slice 2 (Slice 3 will introduce the v3 plan schema).

### Added

- `vault-standards::apply` module with `ApplyError`, `RepairApplyReport`, `validate_plan_for_apply`, `changes_by_path`, `apply_file_changes`. Apply contract logic now lives in the engine crate.
- `vault-frontmatter::top_level_property_spans` returning `PropertySpan { name, line_range, value_range, style }` for byte-range YAML editing.
- `vault-frontmatter::serialize_value_preserving_style` preserving original quote style when possible, upgrading when necessary, never downgrading.

### Changed

- `vault repair apply` now performs minimal-edit YAML rewriting. Untouched lines (including comments, quote style, and key ordering) are preserved byte-for-byte. Touched values preserve the original style when the new value can be expressed in it; double-quoted stays double-quoted, single-quoted stays single-quoted.
- `crates/vault-cli/src/repair_apply.rs` reduced from ~230 lines to ~75 lines of orchestration. All apply contract checks moved to `vault-standards::apply`.

### Notes

- Apply now returns `ApplyError::CannotMinimalEdit` for `set_frontmatter` against block-style or flow-style values. The current repair action set only configures scalar targets, so this is a guard for future expansion.
- The expected-old-value check still treats YAML null as equivalent to absent for the purpose of matching a `None` expected value.

## v0.25.1 - 2026-05-18

Repair workflow documentation polish.

Repair plan usability release.

### Added

- Added `skipped_findings` repair plan fallout with reasons, candidates, and next actions for findings that cannot be planned deterministically.

### Added

- Added `vault repair apply <plan>` for frontmatter-only repair plans with document hash preconditions, expected-old-value checks, dry-run support, changed-file manifests, and optional post-apply validation.
- Added read-only `vault repair links` reports for unresolved links, ambiguous links, path-style Markdown links, duplicate-stem risks, affected files, and target move/delete risk.

## v0.21.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added `vault registry add/list/remove` and global `--vault <name>` targeting using an XDG-style registry file.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-05-17

Direction, human output, and workflow recipe release.

### Added

- Added `table` and `paths` output formats for document inventory inspection.
- Added `table` output for validation summaries.
- Commands with human renderers now default to table output on terminals and JSON output when stdout is piped or captured.
- Documented validation cleanup recipes for filtered summaries, JSONL queues, link failure modes, and raw `--target` matching.

## v0.18.0 - 2026-05-17

Validation triage ergonomics release.

### Added

- Added `vault validate` filters: `--code`, `--severity`, `--field`, `--rule`, `--path`, `--target`, and `--reason`.
- Added comma-separated value sets for validate filters, such as `--code link-unresolved,link-ambiguous`.
- Filtered `vault validate --summary` now summarizes the filtered finding set while preserving the existing summary schema.

### Changed

- Unknown `docs list --has` / `--missing` warnings now name the operator instead of using generic filter wording.

## v0.17.1 - 2026-05-17

Date/datetime validation polish release.

### Changed

- `datetime` field types now accept common ISO/YAML forms including fractional seconds, `Z`, numeric timezone offsets, and space-separated YAML datetime strings.
- `date` field types now accept plain dates plus YAML-normalized midnight datetime strings such as `2026-03-20 00:00:00+00:00`.
- Date validation now checks real month/day bounds, including leap years.

## v0.17.0 - 2026-05-17

Document query ergonomics release.

### Added

- Added `vault docs list --path <glob>` using the same path-segment glob semantics as config paths.
- Added `vault docs list --has <field>` and `--missing <field>` for frontmatter field presence filters.
- Added comma-separated value sets for `vault docs list --filter`, such as `status:backlog,completed`.
- Added `vault docs summary --count-by <field>` for grouped document inventory counts.
- Added warnings for unknown `--has`, `--missing`, and `--count-by` fields.

### Changed

- `vault docs inspect` now defaults to `--format json` because it emits one logical object.

## v0.16.0 - 2026-05-17

CLI surface regroup release. **Breaking command paths and config key rename.**

### Changed

- Replaced the `vault graph` umbrella with top-level command groups:
  - `vault docs list`
  - `vault docs inspect <target>`
  - `vault files`
  - `vault links list`
  - `vault links unresolved`
  - `vault links backlinks <target>`
  - `vault cache build`
- Promoted `--config` and `--verbose` to global flags.
- Renamed config key `graph.ignore` to `files.ignore`.
- Renamed the CLI integration test file from `graph_output.rs` to `cli_output.rs`.

### Added

- `vault docs list --filter <field:value>` now warns on stderr when a filter field is not present in any document frontmatter.
- Legacy `graph.ignore` configs now fail with a clear v0.16 rename error.

### Removed

- Removed `vault graph ...` command paths.
- Removed `vault graph diagnostics`; use `vault validate --format jsonl` to surface graph diagnostics as validation findings.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-05-17

Internal restructure release. **Breaking JSONL output schema for validate findings.**

### Added

- `vault-frontmatter` crate: YAML extraction and shallow property/offset utilities.
- `vault-links` crate: CommonMark link parsing, wikilink parsing, block IDs, anchor helpers, and link resolution.
- `vault-standards` crate: validate engine, `Finding` / `FindingBody` types, summary, predicates, YAML config-schema validator.
- `Finding` sum type replacing the 12-field `ValidateFinding` god-struct. Variant-specific fields only appear on findings that carry them; no more `null` defaults.
- `docs/rule-shape.md`: canonical conceptual model for validate rules (selectors + constraints).
- `Summary.invalid_types` grouping for `frontmatter-invalid-type` findings by field and expected type.

### Changed

- Renamed `vault-index` crate to `vault-graph` (matches the original modular-architecture spec and the command surface name).
- `vault-cli/src/main.rs` reduced from ~1376 lines to ~150 lines of dispatch; per-concern modules (`cli`, `config`, `output`, `filter`, `target`) carry the rest.
- `validate` (formerly `validate_findings`) is now a ~55-line orchestrator in `vault-standards::engine` dispatching to seven per-check functions, each under 40 lines.

### Renamed finding codes (breaking)

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `path-not-allowed` | `document-misrouted` |
| `frontmatter-field-value-not-allowed` | `frontmatter-disallowed-value` |
| `frontmatter-field-type-invalid` | `frontmatter-invalid-type` |
| `frontmatter-field-forbidden` | `frontmatter-forbidden-field` |

Any scripts or agent skills filtering on these codes need to update.

### Output schema (breaking)

`vault validate --format jsonl` rows are still flat JSON objects keyed by `code`, but variant-specific fields (`field`, `actual_value`, `allowed_values`, `expected_type`, `allowed_paths`, `link`, `diagnostic`) only appear on findings that carry them, rather than being emitted as `null` everywhere.

### Unchanged

- CLI command paths (`vault graph documents`, `vault graph backlinks`, `vault validate`, etc.) are identical to v0.14. The CLI surface regroup ships in v0.16.
- Config YAML keys (`graph.ignore`, `validate.required_frontmatter`, etc.) are unchanged. The `graph.ignore` rename ships in v0.16.
