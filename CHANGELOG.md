# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## v0.22.0 - 2026-05-17

Safe apply and link/path planning release.

### Added

- Added `vault repair apply <plan>` for frontmatter-only repair plans with document hash preconditions, expected-old-value checks, dry-run support, changed-file manifests, and optional post-apply validation.
- Added read-only `vault repair links` reports for unresolved links, ambiguous links, path-style Markdown links, duplicate-stem risks, affected files, and target move/delete risk.

## v0.21.0 - 2026-05-17

Repair planning MVP release.

### Added

- Added read-only `vault repair plan` with schema-versioned JSON plans, configured frontmatter repair rules, unsupported finding reporting, and manual-decision reporting.
- Added `repair.rules` config for deterministic frontmatter repairs using `set_frontmatter` and `remove_frontmatter` actions.
- Added documented detect -> plan agent workflows for frontmatter drift healing.

## v0.20.0 - 2026-05-17

Native retrieval and vault targeting release.

### Added

- Added top-level `vault search` with document path filters, frontmatter filters, field presence filters, literal text filters, and JSON/JSONL/table/paths output.
- Added `vault registry add/list/remove` and global `--vault <name>` targeting using an XDG-style registry file.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-05-17

Direction, human output, and workflow recipe release.

### Added

- Added `table` and `paths` output formats for document inventory inspection.
- Added `table` output for validation summaries.
- Commands with human renderers now default to table output on terminals and JSON output when stdout is piped or captured.
- Documented validation cleanup recipes for filtered summaries, JSONL queues, link failure modes, and raw `--target` matching.

### Changed

- Documented deterministic drift healing as the product direction: detect, plan, apply, and verify.

## v0.18.0 - 2026-05-17

Validation triage ergonomics release.

### Added

- Added `vault validate` filters: `--code`, `--severity`, `--field`, `--rule`, `--path`, `--target`, and `--reason`.
- Added comma-separated value sets for validate filters, such as `--code link-unresolved,link-ambiguous`.
- Filtered `vault validate --summary` now summarizes the filtered finding set while preserving the existing summary schema.

### Changed

- Unknown `docs list --has` / `--missing` warnings now name the operator instead of using generic filter wording.

## v0.17.1 - 2026-05-17

Date/datetime validation polish release.

### Changed

- `datetime` field types now accept common ISO/YAML forms including fractional seconds, `Z`, numeric timezone offsets, and space-separated YAML datetime strings.
- `date` field types now accept plain dates plus YAML-normalized midnight datetime strings such as `2026-03-20 00:00:00+00:00`.
- Date validation now checks real month/day bounds, including leap years.

## v0.17.0 - 2026-05-17

Document query ergonomics release.

### Added

- Added `vault docs list --path <glob>` using the same path-segment glob semantics as config paths.
- Added `vault docs list --has <field>` and `--missing <field>` for frontmatter field presence filters.
- Added comma-separated value sets for `vault docs list --filter`, such as `status:backlog,completed`.
- Added `vault docs summary --count-by <field>` for grouped document inventory counts.
- Added warnings for unknown `--has`, `--missing`, and `--count-by` fields.

### Changed

- `vault docs inspect` now defaults to `--format json` because it emits one logical object.

## v0.16.0 - 2026-05-17

CLI surface regroup release. **Breaking command paths and config key rename.**

### Changed

- Replaced the `vault graph` umbrella with top-level command groups:
  - `vault docs list`
  - `vault docs inspect <target>`
  - `vault files`
  - `vault links list`
  - `vault links unresolved`
  - `vault links backlinks <target>`
  - `vault cache build`
- Promoted `--config` and `--verbose` to global flags.
- Renamed config key `graph.ignore` to `files.ignore`.
- Renamed the CLI integration test file from `graph_output.rs` to `cli_output.rs`.

### Added

- `vault docs list --filter <field:value>` now warns on stderr when a filter field is not present in any document frontmatter.
- Legacy `graph.ignore` configs now fail with a clear v0.16 rename error.

### Removed

- Removed `vault graph ...` command paths.
- Removed `vault graph diagnostics`; use `vault validate --format jsonl` to surface graph diagnostics as validation findings.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-05-17

Internal restructure release. **Breaking JSONL output schema for validate findings.**

### Added

- `vault-frontmatter` crate: YAML extraction and shallow property/offset utilities.
- `vault-links` crate: CommonMark link parsing, wikilink parsing, block IDs, anchor helpers, and link resolution.
- `vault-standards` crate: validate engine, `Finding` / `FindingBody` types, summary, predicates, YAML config-schema validator.
- `Finding` sum type replacing the 12-field `ValidateFinding` god-struct. Variant-specific fields only appear on findings that carry them; no more `null` defaults.
- `docs/rule-shape.md`: canonical conceptual model for validate rules (selectors + constraints).
- `Summary.invalid_types` grouping for `frontmatter-invalid-type` findings by field and expected type.

### Changed

- Renamed `vault-index` crate to `vault-graph` (matches the original modular-architecture spec and the command surface name).
- `vault-cli/src/main.rs` reduced from ~1376 lines to ~150 lines of dispatch; per-concern modules (`cli`, `config`, `output`, `filter`, `target`) carry the rest.
- `validate` (formerly `validate_findings`) is now a ~55-line orchestrator in `vault-standards::engine` dispatching to seven per-check functions, each under 40 lines.

### Renamed finding codes (breaking)

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `path-not-allowed` | `document-misrouted` |
| `frontmatter-field-value-not-allowed` | `frontmatter-disallowed-value` |
| `frontmatter-field-type-invalid` | `frontmatter-invalid-type` |
| `frontmatter-field-forbidden` | `frontmatter-forbidden-field` |

Any scripts or agent skills filtering on these codes need to update.

### Output schema (breaking)

`vault validate --format jsonl` rows are still flat JSON objects keyed by `code`, but variant-specific fields (`field`, `actual_value`, `allowed_values`, `expected_type`, `allowed_paths`, `link`, `diagnostic`) only appear on findings that carry them, rather than being emitted as `null` everywhere.

### Unchanged

- CLI command paths (`vault graph documents`, `vault graph backlinks`, `vault validate`, etc.) are identical to v0.14. The CLI surface regroup ships in v0.16.
- Config YAML keys (`graph.ignore`, `validate.required_frontmatter`, etc.) are unchanged. The `graph.ignore` rename ships in v0.16.

## v0.14.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added validation-only `validate.ignore` patterns so files can remain graph-visible while being skipped by standards checks.
- Added scoped rule path exclusions with `match.path_not` and `exclude.path`.
- Added `validate.rules[].field_types` checks for `datetime`, `date`, `list_of_strings`, `wikilink`, and `wikilink_or_list`.
- Added `validate.rules[].forbidden_frontmatter` for absent-field constraints.
- Added `validate.rules[].allowed_paths` for read-only folder-routing validation.
- Added finding context for expected field types and allowed path patterns.

## v0.13.0 - 2026-05-17

- Handled closed stdout pipes gracefully so JSON/JSONL output can be piped into early-exit consumers such as `head` without panic text.
- Added `fields` counts to `vault validate --summary`.

- Added read-only `vault doctor`.
- Added doctor findings for unresolved links, ambiguous links, and document diagnostics.
- Added config-driven required frontmatter checks via `doctor.required_frontmatter`.
