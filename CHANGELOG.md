# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## v0.15.0 - 2026-05-17

Internal restructure release. **Breaking JSONL output schema for validate findings.**

### Added

- `vault-frontmatter` crate: YAML extraction and shallow property/offset utilities.
- `vault-links` crate: CommonMark link parsing, wikilink parsing, block IDs, anchor helpers, and link resolution.
- `vault-standards` crate: validate engine, `Finding` / `FindingBody` types, summary, predicates, YAML config-schema validator.
- `Finding` sum type replacing the 12-field `ValidateFinding` god-struct. Variant-specific fields only appear on findings that carry them; no more `null` defaults.
- `docs/rule-shape.md`: canonical conceptual model for validate rules (selectors + constraints).
- `Summary.invalid_types` grouping for `frontmatter-invalid-type` findings by field and expected type.

### Changed

- Renamed `vault-index` crate to `vault-graph` (matches the original modular-architecture spec and the command surface name).
- `vault-cli/src/main.rs` reduced from ~1376 lines to ~150 lines of dispatch; per-concern modules (`cli`, `config`, `output`, `filter`, `target`) carry the rest.
- `validate` (formerly `validate_findings`) is now a ~55-line orchestrator in `vault-standards::engine` dispatching to seven per-check functions, each under 40 lines.

### Renamed finding codes (breaking)

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `path-not-allowed` | `document-misrouted` |
| `frontmatter-field-value-not-allowed` | `frontmatter-disallowed-value` |
| `frontmatter-field-type-invalid` | `frontmatter-invalid-type` |
| `frontmatter-field-forbidden` | `frontmatter-forbidden-field` |

Any scripts or agent skills filtering on these codes need to update.

### Output schema (breaking)

`vault validate --format jsonl` rows are still flat JSON objects keyed by `code`, but variant-specific fields (`field`, `actual_value`, `allowed_values`, `expected_type`, `allowed_paths`, `link`, `diagnostic`) only appear on findings that carry them, rather than being emitted as `null` everywhere.

### Unchanged

- CLI command paths (`vault graph documents`, `vault graph backlinks`, `vault validate`, etc.) are identical to v0.14. The CLI surface regroup ships in v0.16.
- Config YAML keys (`graph.ignore`, `validate.required_frontmatter`, etc.) are unchanged. The `graph.ignore` rename ships in v0.16.

## v0.14.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added validation-only `validate.ignore` patterns so files can remain graph-visible while being skipped by standards checks.
- Added scoped rule path exclusions with `match.path_not` and `exclude.path`.
- Added `validate.rules[].field_types` checks for `datetime`, `date`, `list_of_strings`, `wikilink`, and `wikilink_or_list`.
- Added `validate.rules[].forbidden_frontmatter` for absent-field constraints.
- Added `validate.rules[].allowed_paths` for read-only folder-routing validation.
- Added finding context for expected field types and allowed path patterns.

## v0.13.0 - 2026-05-17

- Handled closed stdout pipes gracefully so JSON/JSONL output can be piped into early-exit consumers such as `head` without panic text.
- Added `fields` counts to `vault validate --summary`.
- Added `disallowed_values` counts to `vault validate --summary` for configured allowed-value findings.
- Kept raw validation finding JSON/JSONL output unchanged.

## v0.12.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added global `-C, --cwd <dir>` and made commands default to the process current directory.
- Removed command-local `--root` arguments from graph and validate commands.
- Added default config discovery from `<cwd>/.vault/config.yaml` when `--config` is omitted.
- Resolved explicit relative config paths and relative cache paths against the effective cwd.
- Updated Justfile recipes and docs for the cwd-based command surface.

## v0.11.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added `validate.rules[].allowed_values` for type-sensitive scalar frontmatter value validation.
- Added `frontmatter-field-value-not-allowed` findings with `field`, `rule`, `actual_value`, and `allowed_values` context.

- Documented allowed-value validation examples.

## v0.10.0 - 2026-05-17

- Renamed the read-only standards checking command from `vault doctor` to `vault validate`.
- Renamed config rules from `doctor:` to `validate:`.
- Added `vault validate --summary` for grouped finding counts by code, severity, rule, and top-level path prefix.
- Kept raw validation finding JSON/JSONL output unchanged unless `--summary` is requested.

## v0.9.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added `doctor.rules[].match.frontmatter` predicates for top-level frontmatter equality matching.
- ANDed path and frontmatter predicates for scoped doctor rules.
- Added type-sensitive string, boolean, and number comparisons without coercion.

- Updated docs and examples for frontmatter-aware doctor rules and recursive ignore patterns.

## v0.8.0 - 2026-05-17

- Tightened config path glob semantics so `*` matches within one path segment and `**` matches recursive path segments.
- Added matcher tests for workspace root, recursive workspace, and nested notes patterns.
- Added config validation errors for malformed doctor rule shapes.
- Documented glob matching semantics for config path patterns.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-05-17

- Added scoped `doctor.rules` with `match.path`.

- Added read-only `vault doctor`.
- Added doctor findings for unresolved links, ambiguous links, and document diagnostics.
- Added config-driven required frontmatter checks via `doctor.required_frontmatter`.
- Documented `vault doctor` and the ignored-target policy: indexed documents linking to ignored files surface unresolved links rather than hiding the fact.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-05-16

- Added richer `vault graph --help` overview while keeping `vault graph -h` compact.
- Added explicit YAML config support with `--config`.
- Added `graph.ignore` patterns for exact paths, directory prefixes such as `__pycache__/**`, and simple `*` wildcards.

- Emitted local Markdown image links such as `![Alt](Assets/pic.png)` as `kind: "embed"` graph facts.
- Added `vault graph files` for file inventory output.
- Allowed `vault graph backlinks <exact-file-path>` for non-Markdown file targets.

- Expanded long help and docs for graph semantics.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-05-16

- Parsed frontmatter/property wikilinks as graph links.
