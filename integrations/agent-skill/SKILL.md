# vault-cli skill

A deterministic Markdown vault CLI. Use it for graph, link, frontmatter, and validation work against a vault on disk. This skill is harness-independent — every coding agent that follows the standard `.agents/skills/` convention (or `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code) can use it.

## When to use vault

Use `vault` when you need to:

- Inspect a Markdown vault's document inventory, frontmatter, or link graph deterministically.
- Validate a vault against configured rules (`required_frontmatter`, `field_types`, `allowed_values`, `allowed_paths`, etc.).
- Audit unresolved or ambiguous links.
- Surface frontmatter drift for review.
- Produce an inspectable repair plan (`schema_version: 3`) and apply it explicitly.

Do not use `vault` when you need full-text or semantic search — its `search` command is exact literal substring + frontmatter + path glob.

## Vault root targeting

Before running any command, pick a vault root. Three ways:

1. **Inline.** `vault -C /path/to/vault validate --summary --format json`
2. **Registered name.** `vault registry add myvault /path/to/vault` once, then `vault --vault myvault validate --summary --format json`. Registry lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vault/registry.yaml`.
3. **Process cwd.** If neither `-C` nor `--vault` is set, `vault` runs against the current directory and discovers `.vault/config.yaml` if it exists.

`--vault` and `-C` are mutually exclusive. When in doubt, use `-C <path>`.

## Read-only commands (safe to run anytime)

None of these write to the vault:

- `vault docs list / summary / inspect`
- `vault files`
- `vault links list / unresolved / backlinks`
- `vault search`
- `vault validate` (with or without `--summary` or filters)
- `vault repair plan` (produces an artifact; does not modify the vault)
- `vault repair links` (planning report only)

Only `vault repair apply` writes to the vault. It requires an explicit plan argument.

## Validation summary first, raw findings second

`vault validate --summary --format json` returns grouped counts (by code, severity, rule, field, disallowed value, path prefix). Always run the summary first to size the work, then re-run without `--summary` to read individual findings.

```bash
vault --vault myvault validate --summary --format json
vault --vault myvault validate --code frontmatter-disallowed-value --field status --summary --format json
vault --vault myvault validate --code frontmatter-disallowed-value --field status --format jsonl
```

The same filter set works for raw output and summaries.

## Stable JSON / JSONL contracts

Use `--format json` for one-shot agent dispatch (single JSON document). Use `--format jsonl` for streaming queues (one JSON object per line). Table output is for humans and may evolve between point releases — never parse it.

Finding codes are stable. Renames are called out as breaking changes in the project's CHANGELOG.

## Filter-based triage

`vault validate` filters apply to both raw output and `--summary`:

| Filter | Matches |
|---|---|
| `--code` | Finding code. |
| `--severity` | `warning` or `error`. |
| `--field` | Frontmatter field name. |
| `--rule` | Rule name. |
| `--path` | Vault-relative path glob. |
| `--target` | Raw parsed link target string (exact match). |
| `--reason` | Unresolved-link reason. |

Comma-separated values within one filter are ORed (`--code link-unresolved,link-ambiguous`); different filters are ANDed.

## User-specific vault doctrine lives in .vault/config.yaml

Don't hardcode vault-specific rule names, field shapes, or status vocabularies into agent prompts. Read them from `<vault-root>/.vault/config.yaml`. The config declares:

- `files.ignore` — graph-level ignores.
- `validate.ignore` — validate-skip patterns (the files stay in the graph).
- `validate.required_frontmatter` — global presence requirement.
- `validate.rules` — scoped rules with selectors and constraints.
- `repair.rules` — deterministic frontmatter repairs.

If a vault has no config, defaults apply.

## Plan/apply boundary

Mutation is always two steps. Never write to the vault outside `vault repair apply`.

1. `vault --vault myvault repair plan --out repair.json`
2. Inspect `repair.json`. Read `summary.planned_changes` and `summary.skipped.*` counts.
3. `vault --vault myvault repair apply repair.json --dry-run --format json` — confirms the plan applies cleanly.
4. `vault --vault myvault repair apply repair.json --verify --format json` — writes and re-validates.

Apply rejects:

- Plans for a different vault root than the current invocation.
- Stale document hashes (a file changed since the plan was created).
- Unsupported schema versions (currently `3`).
- Conflicting field changes.
- Expected-old-value mismatches.

Re-plan rather than retrying. There is no `--force` flag.

## Typical agent loop

```bash
# 1. Detect
vault --vault myvault validate --summary --format json

# 2. Triage (size the queue)
vault --vault myvault validate \
  --code frontmatter-disallowed-value \
  --field status \
  --summary --format json

# 3. Plan
vault --vault myvault repair plan \
  --code frontmatter-disallowed-value \
  --field status \
  --out repair.json

# 4. Review
# (read repair.json; surface skipped_findings to the human if non-empty)

# 5. Dry-run
vault --vault myvault repair apply repair.json --dry-run --format json

# 6. Apply with verification
vault --vault myvault repair apply repair.json --verify --format json
```

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't filter by un-indexed fields.** `vault docs list --filter` matches frontmatter scalar or list values only. For body text matching, use `vault search --text "..."`.
- **Honor schema versions.** Repair plans declare `schema_version`. Apply rejects mismatched versions; re-plan instead of editing the artifact.
- **Don't auto-pick ambiguous link candidates.** `link-ambiguous` findings carry a `candidates` list, but the CLI does not resolve them. Surface the ambiguity to the human or apply a deterministic disambiguation rule documented in the vault's config.
- **Use `--out` for plan artifacts.** `vault repair plan --out repair.json` writes the plan directly. Shell redirection (`> repair.json`) works but is more prone to partial-write footguns.
- **Don't parse table output.** Tables are for humans. Always pass `--format json` or `--format jsonl` from an agent context.
- **Run `--summary` first.** It's cheaper than a full finding stream and tells you whether a more expensive query is worth running.
