# Vault cache

`vault` uses a SQLite-backed cache to accelerate query commands. The cache is the read path for `vault validate`, `vault docs`, `vault files`, `vault links`, and `vault repair` — these commands open the cache, refresh it incrementally if needed, and load the graph in-memory before running their existing logic.

## Where it lives

```text
~/.cache/vault/<sha256-of-canonical-vault-root>/cache.db
```

Honors `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` when set. The directory is created at `0700` and the database file at `0600` — explicitly tightened (not relying on umask) to protect frontmatter values on shared hosts.

The cache identity is derived from the canonical path of the vault root (symlinks resolved). Querying via `--vault registry-name`, the symlinked path, or the resolved target all hit the same cache.

## Surface

```text
vault cache index               # incremental update (default)
vault cache index --rebuild     # full rebuild from scratch
vault cache index --force-hash  # skip mtime cheap-check; hash every file
vault cache rebuild             # explicit alias for `index --rebuild`
vault cache clear               # delete the cache; next command rebuilds
vault cache status              # path, size, doc/link/file counts, schema version
```

Every cache subcommand accepts the global `-C`, `--vault`, and `--config` flags; `status` accepts `--format json|table` like other query commands.

## When the cache rebuilds automatically

The cache is *disposable*. Any of the following triggers an automatic silent rebuild (one-line stderr message; exit code 0):

- Cache file missing (first run, or after `vault cache clear`).
- Cache schema version older than the binary expects.
- SQLite file corruption (open failure or `PRAGMA integrity_check` mismatch).
- Vault root identity drift (cache was built against a different canonical path).

A cache with a *newer* schema version than the binary supports is the one case that hard-errors — interpreting unknown future fields would be unsafe. Upgrade `vault` to read it.

The current `schema_version` is `2`. It is surfaced by `vault cache status` and stamped into the `meta` table on every rebuild.

## `--force-hash`

Skips the `(mtime, size)` cheap-check during change detection; reads and hashes every file. Use on filesystems where mtime is unreliable:

- NFS shared vaults (mtime can lag several seconds).
- Docker bind-mounts on macOS / WSL.
- Vaults restored from `rsync --times`, `tar -p`, or backup tools that copy mtime verbatim.
- Post-`git-restore-mtime` workflows that touch timestamps.

## `--no-cache-refresh`

Query commands implicitly refresh the cache before reading. Pass the global `--no-cache-refresh` flag to skip that step — useful when batching many commands in a CI pipeline that already ran `vault cache index` explicitly, or when investigating cache state without changing it.

```bash
vault cache index
vault --no-cache-refresh validate --summary --format json
vault --no-cache-refresh links unresolved --format jsonl
```

## What's cached

Stored: document path, stem, content hash, frontmatter, body text, mtime, size; outgoing links with resolved targets (including the unresolved reason and candidate list for ambiguous links); headings; block IDs; non-Markdown file inventory.

Not stored: validation findings — they depend on `.vault/config.yaml`, which can change between runs. Findings always recompute fresh against the in-memory graph loaded from the cache.

## Performance targets

- Cold rebuild on a 1000-document vault: under 2 seconds.
- Warm read for `vault validate`: under 100 ms on a vault with no filesystem changes.
- `vault cache status`: under 50 ms.

If you're seeing significantly slower numbers, run `vault cache rebuild` to start from a clean slate. The performance regression test in `crates/vault-cache/tests/perf.rs` locks in the 1000-doc target — opt in with `cargo test -p vault-cache --ignored`.

## Schema evolution

The schema is versioned. Bumps trigger a silent auto-rebuild on next open. The current version is exposed via `vault cache status`.

Future evolution (planned, not in this release):

- Full-text search via SQLite FTS5 over body text and frontmatter values.
- SQL-direct query path (commands issue SQL instead of loading the in-memory `GraphIndex`).
- MCP server with a file watcher driving cache updates without explicit invocations.

## Concurrency

Writes are serialized by an advisory file lock (`fs2`). Two simultaneous `vault cache index` runs will queue rather than race; readers never block, because reads go through SQLite's WAL mode and the in-memory `GraphIndex` is rebuilt on each command. The integration test at `crates/vault-cache/tests/concurrency.rs` exercises the lock path.
